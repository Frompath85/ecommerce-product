# E-commerce product page

In this challenge I build e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The Web site is able to:

- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
<!-- - View the cart and remove items from it *not yet developper* -->

This project is developped using : 

**React Vite** - **HTML** - **CSS** - **JS**
